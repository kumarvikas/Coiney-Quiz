UNIX:
1.Describe how to spawn a new process.
Ans:1. Kernel has to take an existing process and then copy all of it into another part of memory. 
    2. It creates kernel entries to support the new process. 
    3. Finally it gives control of the cpu to user space in the new process
All the above steps are done by fork() which is called as spawning of a new process.
