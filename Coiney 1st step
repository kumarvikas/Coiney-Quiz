UNIX:
1.Describe how to spawn a new process.
Ans:1. Kernel has to take an existing process and then copy all of it into another part of memory. 
    2. It creates kernel entries to support the new process. 
    3. Finally it gives control of the cpu to user space in the new process
All the above steps are done by fork() which is called as spawning of a new process.

2.Describe how a process scheduler can be implemented, including any algorithms and data structures you would use.
3.Why are system calls slow?
Ans: System calls are not usually slow but some system calls are slow. Slow system calls potentially requires waiting 
for another task to comaplete, so the kernel must prepare to pause the calling process and run another task.

Algorithms:
// Reverse an integer n > 0; e.g., 213 âˆ’> 312.
int reverse(int n);
Ans:
	private static void reverseInt(int n) {
		int reverse = 0;
		while (n != 0) {
			reverse = reverse * 10;
	        reverse = reverse + n%10;
	        n = n/10;
		}
		System.out.println(reverse);
	}

// Evaluate whether an integer n > 0 is symmetrical; e.g., 101 -> true
int symmetrical(int n);
Ans:
	private static void symmetrical(int n) {
		int reverse = 0;
		int temp = n;
		while (n != 0) {
			reverse = reverse * 10;
	        reverse = reverse + n%10;
	        n = n/10;
		}
		if (reverse == temp) {
			System.out.println("Integer is symmetrical");
		} else {
			System.out.println("Integer is not symmetrical");
		}
	}
