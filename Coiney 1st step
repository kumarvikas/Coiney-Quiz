UNIX:
1.Describe how to spawn a new process.
Ans:1. Kernel has to take an existing process and then copy all of it into another part of memory. 
    2. It creates kernel entries to support the new process. 
    3. Finally it gives control of the cpu to user space in the new process
All the above steps are done by fork() which is called as spawning of a new process.

2.Describe how a process scheduler can be implemented, including any algorithms and data structures you would use.
3.Why are system calls slow?
Ans: System calls are not usually slow but some system calls are slow. Slow system calls potentially requires waiting 
for another task to comaplete, so the kernel must prepare to pause the calling process and run another task.

Algorithms:
// Reverse an integer n > 0; e.g., 213 âˆ’> 312.
int reverse(int n);
Ans:
	private static void reverseInt(int n) {
		int reverse = 0;
		while (n != 0) {
			reverse = reverse * 10;
	        reverse = reverse + n%10;
	        n = n/10;
		}
		System.out.println(reverse);
	}

// Evaluate whether an integer n > 0 is symmetrical; e.g., 101 -> true
int symmetrical(int n);
Ans:
	private static void symmetrical(int n) {
		int reverse = 0;
		int temp = n;
		while (n != 0) {
			reverse = reverse * 10;
	        reverse = reverse + n%10;
	        n = n/10;
		}
		if (reverse == temp) {
			System.out.println("Integer is symmetrical");
		} else {
			System.out.println("Integer is not symmetrical");
		}
	}

Databases:
1.Describe how indexing works, including any algorithms and data structures that can be used.
Ans:
Indexing is used to sort number of fields on multiple records. In a table, an index on a field created another 
data structure which holds field value and pointer to the record it relates to. This index structure is then 
sorted, allowing Binary Searches to be performed on it.
Binary search is one of the best algorithm we can use here.

2. What is normalization?
Ans:
To organize data into tables by removing redundacny and inconsistent dependency. Basically it the process to 
simplfy and divide data into tables with relationship with each table.
Types of normalization:
1NF, 2NF, 3Nf and BCNF

3. What are some situations in which denormalization is necessary?
Ans:
Below are some situations in which denormalization required:
a) To present data in readily format
b) To remove joins so that performace can be improved
c) To avoid certain complex queries

4. Explain the differences between INNER JOIN, FULL OUTER JOIN, and LEFT OUTER JOIN.
Ans:
INNER JOIN - gives set of records which are common in table T1 and table T2
FULL OUTER JOIN - gives set of all records from tabel T1 and T2, with matching records from both side if available.
If no match found corresponding side with have null
LEFT OUTER JOIN - gives set of all records from Left table with matching records from right table if available. If no
match found then right side will contain null.
